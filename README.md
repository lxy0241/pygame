# <h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>This is a Python Ping Pong Game. The game combines the classic elements of Ping Pong with a twist: before the game begins, players need to complete a Rock-Paper-Scissors(RPS) match to determine who serves first. The ball always starts from the winner's side, and the game's difficulty increases as the speed progressively ramps up, providing a fun and challenging experience. </h3>
